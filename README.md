# first-project_nailsalon
This project was created for an assigment for the Introduction to JavaScript Class. I attended this class in the period of october to december of 2021.
The requirements for this project: 
  (1) It has to be written in Vanilla JS.
  (2) It has to use some API.
  (3) It has to have at least one server with two or more directions for the user.
  (4) It can be about whatever you want.
The idea I wanted to portray was a page where any client could make a reservation for an appoinment in a particular nail salon. The page will first show some images, chosen for the owner of the salon; in the second page there will be a description and a little introduction to the nails techs; the third and final (for now) page is where the clients could make their reservations. In the reservation page they have to enter their name, their age and their cellphone and mail, finally, they have to choose a date and hour among the available options.

This is my first (almost) real project in any languaje so I know there are a lot of things that i can improve and I'm looking foward to doing that.
